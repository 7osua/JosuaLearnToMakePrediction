# JosuaLearnToMakePrediction
This research or project is a part that I also use as a final project (dissertation). 
There are two documents with modeling methods using RNN and LSTM.

# Predictions of Tourist Visits Using the Recurrent Neural Network and LSTM
Some methods that I have used to make predictions
(Regression Problems)
- Univariate Time Series Analysis
- Resampling Using Cubic Spline
- Prpocessing data (Stasionary, Normalization, Supervised learning)
- Modeling with RNN and LSTM
- Evaluation (RMSE)

# First Folder, 01-TugasAkhirEnv-RNN
- Time series analysis (Stasionerity)
- Upsampling from monthly to weekly (Interpolation)
- Upsampling from monthly to daily (Interpolation)
- Predict With monthly data (01-XX)
- Predict With weekly data (02-XX)
- Predict With daily data (03-XX)
- 3 dataset (CSV)

# First Folder, 02-TugasAkhirEnv-LSTM
- Time series analysis (Stasionerity)
- Upsampling from monthly to weekly (Interpolation)
- Upsampling from monthly to daily (Interpolation)
- Predict With monthly data (01-XX)
- Predict With weekly data (02-XX)
- Predict With daily data (03-XX)
- 3 dataset (CSV)
